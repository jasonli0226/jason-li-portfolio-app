# CLAUDE.md - Personal Portfolio Website

**Project:** Jason Li – AI Data Architect Portfolio  
**Tech Stack:** Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion  
**Deployment:** Vercel  
**Goal:** Build a modern, fast, professional single-page portfolio website to showcase Jason’s experience as an AI Data Architect. The site should be clean, minimalist, dark/light mode enabled, fully responsive, and highlight his strong Agentic AI, LLM, and GenAI expertise. Link this site in his CV.

## 1. Project Setup Requirements

- Use `npm create vite@latest jason-li-portfolio -- --template react-ts`

- Install shadcn-ui
- Additional packages:
  ```bash
  npm install framer-motion lucide-react
  npm install -D @types/node
  ```
- Use modern React patterns (functional components, hooks, TypeScript).
- Project must be fully responsive (mobile-first).

## 2. Design & UI/UX Guidelines

- **Theme:** Modern tech aesthetic – clean, minimalist, professional.
- **Color Palette:** Dark mode default (deep navy/black background with cyan/blue accents). Light mode supported.
- **Typography:** Clean sans-serif (Inter or system sans). Large, bold headings.
- **Animations:** Subtle Framer Motion scroll animations (fade-in, slide-up on sections).
- **Navbar:** Sticky, transparent on scroll, logo on left, menu items (Home, About, Experience, Projects, Skills, Awards, Contact), dark/light toggle, “Download CV” button.
- **Mobile:** Hamburger menu.
- **Overall Feel:** Fast, scannable, premium – like a senior tech leader’s portfolio.
